## Platform and feature policy

- One installation and database serve one customer project.
- Do not add tenant IDs or tenant-aware global scopes.
- Feature availability comes from `feature_settings` through `FeatureGate`.
- Do not gate runtime behavior by package or subscription codes. That cluster — packages,
  package_features, project_subscription, addons, invoices — has been removed: it billed the
  vendor's own plans, not the shop's business. FeatureGate reads feature_settings directly.
- Preserve the existing superadmin feature bypass unless the user explicitly changes policy.

## Identity and ownership

- Admin users have a non-null role; customers have `role_id = null`.
- Permission codes are `<module>.<action>` and are declared only in `App\Support\PermissionRegistry`;
  never add a code without a route that enforces it, and never enforce a code the registry lacks.
- Role permissions live on the `role_permission` pivot; `user_permissions` grants or revokes per
  account. `Gate::before` resolves superadmin, then override, then role.
- Nobody may grant a permission they do not themselves hold, edit their own overrides, or strip
  permissions that sit outside their own reach.
- Admin/customer Sanctum tokens have distinct abilities.
- Inactive users must lose usable access; consider token/session revocation on sensitive changes.
- Every user-owned query must scope by authenticated user, not only by route-model binding.
- Impersonation is superadmin-only and must retain a safe path back to the originating identity.

## Catalog and localization

- Product/category/post names and descriptions follow existing translatable storage.
- Localized slug lookup must use the locale-aware slug layer.
- Products with variant inventory are selected by complete option-value combinations.
- Public clients submit `option_value_ids`; they do not choose a raw variant ID.
- Variant/product relationship, active status, SKU, price, and stock are server-validated.

## Pricing and checkout

The authoritative calculation is:

```text
database price
  -> automatic promotion
  -> voucher on promotion-adjusted subtotal
  -> server shipping fee
  -> grand total
```

Never trust client price, discount, shipping fee, stock, payment status, or totals.

Checkout must:

- Lock products/variants participating in stock checks.
- Reject inactive or unrelated catalog records.
- Enforce active and integrated payment methods.
- Reserve promotion/voucher usage transactionally.
- Create order item snapshots.
- Deduct stock through `OrderStockService`.
- Create a pending payment transaction.
- Dispatch dependent notifications after commit.

## Order and inventory lifecycle

Order transitions:

```text
pending -> processing | cancelled
processing -> completed | cancelled
completed -> terminal
cancelled -> terminal
```

Payment transitions:

```text
pending -> paid | failed
failed -> pending | paid
paid -> partially_refunded | refunded
partially_refunded -> refunded
refunded -> terminal
```

Use `OrderStateTransitionService` for state changes. Use `OrderStockService` for every sale,
cancellation, return, and refund stock movement.

Inventory movement idempotency keys prevent double deduction/restoration. Do not bypass the ledger.
Legacy variant movements may have different restoration semantics; preserve the compatibility path.

## Payments and webhooks

### VNPAY

- Allow only configured official gateway URLs.
- Enable mock mode only in `local`/`testing`.
- Sign and verify only supported `vnp_*` fields.
- Verify configured TMN code, signature, order payment method, exact amount, response, and transaction.
- Browser return never mutates the payment state.
- IPN owns payment mutation and transaction idempotency.
- Remove secure hashes/secrets before persistence or logging.

### SePay

- SePay watches a bank account instead of redirecting: checkout hands the customer a VietQR
  image plus a payment code, and the webhook that follows is the only thing that may settle
  the order. Nothing the storefront reports back changes payment state.
- The QR host is fixed in `SePayService`; operators configure a bank code and account number,
  never a URL.
- The payment code is `order_number` without its separator, optionally prefixed. `Order::NUMBER_PREFIX`
  and `Order::NUMBER_RANDOM_LENGTH` define that shape for both the generator and the matcher —
  changing the order-number format without them breaks webhook matching silently.
- Authenticate every webhook: HMAC-SHA256 over `{timestamp}.{raw_body}` when SePay signs the call
  (with a timestamp window against replay), API key otherwise. An unconfigured secret is never
  "no authentication needed".
- Ignore `transferType=out` and transfers landing on an account other than the configured one.
- `id` is the idempotency key. Settle on `transferAmount >= grand_total`; record an underpayment
  as a transaction without touching order state.
- Answer `{"success": true}` for every outcome already reasoned about so SePay stops retrying;
  reserve a 5xx for failures that genuinely need redelivery.

### GHTK

- Push only to the explicit GHTK URL allow-list.
- Webhook requires realtime tracking enabled and a constant-time token comparison.
- Validate payload bounds and map only permitted state transitions.
- Fingerprint callback events and treat duplicates idempotently.
- Lock the order before state/stock updates.

## Reviews and public data

- A completed order containing the product is required.
- One customer may create one review per product.
- Member duplicate identity uses user ID and account email.
- Guest duplicate identity uses normalized order email.
- Serialize duplicate check/create to resist concurrent duplicate submissions.
- Public review resources expose customer name/rating/comment but not customer email.

Public settings/resources must never expose:

- Cost price.
- Integration settings.
- SMTP/API/payment/shipping credentials.
- Passwords or reset tokens.
- Reviewer email.
- Full encrypted payloads.

## Security boundaries

- Sanitize permitted rich HTML through `HtmlSanitizer`.
- Escape ordinary Blade output with `{{ }}`.
- Validate upload content, size, folder, and server-derived extension.
- Keep uploaded executable formats blocked at application and web-server layers.
- Use URL allow-lists for server-side HTTP calls and redirect targets.
- Apply rate limits to authentication and abuse-prone public flows.
- Keep CSRF protection on session-authenticated state changes.
- Use parameterized queries; never concatenate user input into raw SQL.
- Use generic public errors where detailed distinctions enable enumeration.
